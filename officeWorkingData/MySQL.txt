what is databse?
so, Database is simply a structured collection on data.

The data within the databse is naturally related like a product is related to product catgery and is associated with the multiple tags. Hence, we use the term Relationnal Database.

In relational db we model data like product, category, tags etc using tables. A table contaions rows and coloumn, like spreadsheet.
Tables can relate to another table using various relationship types like one-to-one, many-to-one.

to handle the various works on the data we need SQL.

SQL : SQL is the language of relational databse.
      SQL stands for Structured Query language
      SQL is the standardize language used to access relational databse.

      sql contain three parts - 
      1. DDL - Data Definition Language.... DDL includes the statements for defining the databse and its objects such as tables, triggers, stored procedures etc.
      2. DML - Data manipulation Language.... DML contains the statements for updating and querying data.
      3. DCL - Data Control Language.... DCL allows to grant the permission to user to access specific data in databse.
